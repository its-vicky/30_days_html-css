# 30_days_html-css
Hii there, This is Vikas Choudhari. I am following the 30-day HTML and CSS challenge. I want to become a front-end developer. That is my first challenge: to continue learning and earning new skills, which will help me grow. I earn new skills using some social networking platforms, including YouTube, Udemy, and Great Learning Courses.
